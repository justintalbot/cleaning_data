## This repository contains the following files:

1. code_book.txt
2. run_analysis.R
3. mean_and_std.csv
4. activity_and_subject.csv

## Description of the files

* code_book.txt contains all information on where the data originated and the two csv files' variable names. It also details
how the original data was transformed to create the two csv files.

* run_analysis.R is the script used in R to transform and clean the data into the two csv files.

* mean_and_std.csv is a dataset that contains all of the mean and standard deviation calculations
for all subjects and the tests they performed.
